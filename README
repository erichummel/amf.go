amf.go

A Go library for using Adobe's AMF (Action Message Format)

Here's more information on Action Message Format:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Message_Format

This library can be used either as a binary protocol (such as with a flex.net.Socket),
or as a full-blown server gateway for Flex remoting (such as with mx.messaging.*)

# Current Status #

The library is still a work in progress.
